# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
We were tasked with creating a DataFrame of the PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, and rural) and to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type which will help decisions be made at PyBer.
## Results

### Summary DataFrame

By calculating the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Avg. Fare per Ride, and Avg. Fare per Driver for Rural, Suburban, and Urban Cities we can conclude the following:
- The Urban city type had the highest number of rides, drivers and total fares, but their avg. fare per ride and driver were the lowest. Just the high number of drivers and rides in the densely populated urban city accounts for the highest total fares. 
- The Rural city type had the highest avg. fare per ride and the highest avg. fare per driver, but only had a total of 125 drivers and 78 rides and the lowest total fares.  
- The Suburban city type had half the total fares of the urban city type, but only a fifth of the drivers and a third of the total rides.
### Total Fare by City Type

When looking at the Total Fares by City Type for only the January through April timeframe, we can see that the fares started to increase at the end of February for all city types.  The beginning of the year seemed to be the slowest and starts to slowly ramp up for the end of February peak. The urban city type sees some peaks and dips through the month of March and starts to dip by the end of April.  The suburban fares dip right after the end of February peak and stay steady until they start to ramp back up end of April.  You see the rural fares ramp back up first of April and then slowly drop back down by the end of the month.


## Summary and Recommendations

Looking at the amount of drivers in the Urban city type (5 times more drivers than the suburban city type and almost 30 times more than the rural city type), PyBer could look at decreasing the amount of total drivers to help increase the Avg. Fare per Driver. Could they utilize those drivers elsewhere or could they invest some advertising dollars into generating more rides to keep those drivers busy and help increase the avg. fare and ride per driver? If they were to advertise, based on the Total Fare by City type, the mid-end of February would be a good time to launch a campaign. Since the suburban total fares is half the amount of the urban city type, but they have about a fifth of the drivers, would it be beneficial to focus on the suburban city type and putting some effort into trying to increase the total rides. It would be interesting to see the distance all of these rides are going per city type as well.
