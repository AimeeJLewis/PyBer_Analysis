# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
We were tasked with creating a DataFrame of the PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, and rural) and to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type which will help decisions be made at PyBer.
## Results

### Summary DataFrame

By calculating the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Avg. Fare per Ride, and Avg. Fare per Driver for Rural, Suburban, and Urban Cities we can conclude the following:
- The Urban city type had the highest number of rides, drivers and total fares, but their avg. fare per ride and driver were the lowest. Just the high number of drivers and rides in the densely populated urban city accounts for the highest total fares. 
- The Rural city type had the highest avg. fare per ride and the highest avg. fare per driver, but only had a total of 125 drivers and 78 rides and the lowest total fares.  
- The Suburban city type had half the total fares of the urban city type, but only a fifth of the drivers and a third of the total rides.
### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary and Recommendations

Looking at the amount of drivers in the Urban city type (5 times more drivers than the suburban city type and almost 30 times more than the rural city type), PyBer could look at decreasing the amount of total drivers to help increase the Avg. Fare per Driver. Could they utilize those
